# Microservices-Patterns-Chris-Richardson

 The high-level definition of microservice architecture (microservices) is an architectural style that functionally decomposes an application into a set of services.
 The microservice architecture uses services as the unit of modularity. A service has an API, which is an impermeable boundary that is difficult to violate.
 There are other benefits of using services as building blocks, including the ability to deploy and scale them independently.

 The microservice architecture has the following benefits:
 It enables the continuous delivery and deployment of large, complex applications.
 Services are small and easily maintained.
 Services are independently deployable.
 Services are independently scalable.
 The microservice architecture enables teams to be autonomous.
 It allows easy experimenting and adoption of new technologies.
 It has better fault isolation
